1). Create a login.php page with a basic login form. Hardcode the username and password. Implement session variables to track failed login attempts. Upon successful login, redirect the user to index.php, displaying their username and the current date. Set a session variable 'authenticated' to true upon successful login. Create a logout page to destroy session variables. Lastly, automatically redirect users to login.php if they are not logged in and to index.php if they attempt to access login.php while already logged in.
2). Sign up for an account at filess.io. Set up a new MariaDB database, ensuring that no other database engine is selected. Connect the website to the database (filess.io). Create a table named "users". Allow users to create an account. Check if the account name already exists. Store passwords securely and ensure they meet a minimum security standard. Update the login code so that it's not hard-coded, and users can log in using their account details.Hash the password. When users log in, use the query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$_REQUEST['username']'". Then hash the password they entered in the login form and compare it to the hash in the users table. If they match, the correct password has been entered.
