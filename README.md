Create a login.php page with a basic login form. Hardcode the username and password. Implement session variables to track failed login attempts. Upon successful login, redirect the user to index.php, displaying their username and the current date. Set a session variable 'authenticated' to true upon successful login. Create a logout page to destroy session variables. Lastly, automatically redirect users to login.php if they are not logged in and to index.php if they attempt to access login.php while already logged in.
